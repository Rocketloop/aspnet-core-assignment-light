# Backend Assignment: (Very) Simple Todos API

The assignment involves the creation of a TODO  REST JSON API using ASP.NET Core. Please use the following libraries and versions:

* ASP.NET Core 2.2+

**Updated @ May'19**

## Simple TODO API (2-4h)

Create a CRUD (Create, Update, Delete) API for a simple TODO Management application. A TODO contains a title (str), done (bool), a created (datetime) and updated (datetime) timestamp.

Via a REST API it must be possible to:

*   List all TODOs
*   List only uncompleted TODOs
*   Change a TODOs title or status
*   Delete a TODO
*   Create an extra `statistics` route that returns the following statistics: Total number of todos, percentage of todos done, percentage of todos older than 30 days. 

User management and authentication is are **NOT** required. The data doesn't have to be persisted, this repository already holds the basic data structures and a configured in-memory database
